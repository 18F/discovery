Diverse had already applied a successful application under contract to a previous lot 6 weeks earlier and this contract was to apply to the adjacent lot. 

Upon arrival to Ft. Hood Texas from St. Louis Missouri my subcontractor did not show up. I tried to reschedule this very simple application with the government but they chose to go a different route.

I honestly can not understand why they would not reschedule and moreover why they would actually post this as a ""termination for cause"" for such a small job and under the above circumstances.

Other than this our record with the government is impeccable after over 150 jobs in the last 5 years.

Please call me personally should you need further information on this issue.

Discussions were not held until 8/19/11. On 9/8/11 the contract was awarded with an expected start date to begin on 9/9/11.  The order required VSE to discuss logistics with the end user/client customer. The government was unable to meet with VSE to provide base access and points of contact until 9/15/11.  Based on the 5 week delay in award as outlined above and the short contract POP (6 months), the personnel originally proposed for this effort were no longer available to support the contract.  VSE advised the Client regarding a need to substitute personnel on the telecom held 9/15/11 and did provide candidates for consideration.  VSE provided a written response prior to date and time required by the Government on 9/21/11 in support of the ¿Government intends to cancel the contract and award to another vendor"". VSE¿s response included a request for rescinding the award which supported the Governments intention to award to another vendor.

SSI further adds that one particular government caused delay resulted from a finding on behalf of SSI Technology whereby a government approved (and only) source of supply for a critical component found on this same NSN (contract SPRDL1-09-C-010), had made a change to their design and was no longer compliant to the governments drawing.

ArmorWorks filed a complaint with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (""ASBCA"") wherein ArmorWorks alleged that the default termination was improper for at least the following reasons:

        1.  ArmorWorks alleged that the Army had previously agreed not to terminate ArmorWorks for default based upon a failure of the FAT, and the Army was legally required to give written notice if it was not going to honor that      agreement.
        2.  The Army has produced the test report upon which the Army based its conclusion that ArmorWorks had failed the FAT.  ArmorWorks alleged that report shows that:
                a.  The Army applied testing standards that were not part of the Contract; and,
                b.  Army testing methods were badly flawed, and failed to conform to the Contracts requirements.

After a mediation session with the presiding ASBCA judge, on or about March 16, 2012 the parties reached an agreement in principle to convert the termination for default to a termination for convenience.  The parties are negotiating the precise terms of the settlement, and further details are available upon request from ArmorWorks."

This default termination resulted from just these causes. One CLIN for one position was terminated from this task order. There were a total of 38 positions across 36 AF bases. This position was for a Clinical Psychologist to work at Fairchild AFB. Prior to the termination, we identified 9 candidates looking for work in the Spokane, WA area. Invariable the agreements to work were rescinded and in four cases it was due to ""the incident at the hospital"".  In 2010 an incident that happened in June 1994 was memorialized. A yound airman entered the Fairchild AFB hospital annex with an assault rifle and shot and killed the psychiatrist that was the chief of psychological services at the base and then shot and killed a clinical psychologist. The airman went on to kill 2 more people and wound 22 others before killing himself. AF mental health experts recommended at least 4 times that the airman be discharged or institutionalized and these findings were chiefly ignored. Instead, the airman was kept in uniform and reassigned and was allowed to stay in the military for 22 months before this incident. This is the incident at the hospital which made it challenging to recruit within the time frame demanded. When this 1 position was terminated, we had presented a qualified candidate that was interested in working at the base, however, he was locked into a contract and could not start until approx 90 days later. The AF deemed our cure to fill the position unacceptable and termed for default. There is a stignma to working in the mental health facility which impacted our ability to fill the position. This stigma is not our responsbility and the AF has not cooperated with us to fill the position, cooperation which is necessary because of the stigma created by the AF.  We are appealing the decision US Court of Federal Claims."

Subject: RE: Termination Notice: Kinnick High School Athletic Officials 
 
Ms. Riley, as you may be aware, the situation at Yokosuka is not as cut and dry as we would like. There has developed over a period years a situation whereby the purity, and integrity, of the contracting system has been subverted.  
 
JASOA is not registered on the CCR, nor is Mr. Law or Mr. Henry registered on the CCR.  They cannot competitively bid on the contracts you put out, they know that.  That said, any contractor who unwittingly steps into what they see as their domain they repeatedly boycott and thereby force the government to do a BPA with them for each sport.  This subverts both the integrity , and the free enterprise, of the contracting process.  And, this has been taking place for years.
 
My point is that we gave ample time with our request to be withdrawn from this contract for this to take place. 
 
Now, in light of the above facts, and in all fairness, I am requesting that 4 Peaks be released from this contract without any negative consequences and that a neutral termination, without cause, be found.  
 
As an aside, we have been working in coordination with the soccer commissioner, and we can, through him, provide soccer officials.
 
Now, in closing, I hope this email does not come off as confrontational to you.  I am simply trying to lay out some of the facts that you may, or may not be, aware of; and then to appeal to your innate sense of fairness in any determination that you make.
 
If you have any questions, I would be glad to speak with you in person.  My cell number is:  217-552-6673.
 
Very Respectfully,   John Morton  
Additionally, JASOA is currently under a review/investigation by governmentfor their business practices."

Subject: RE: Termination Notice: Kinnick High School Athletic Officials  

Ms. Riley, as you may be aware, the situation at Yokosuka is not as cut and dry as we would like. There has developed over a period years a situation whereby the purity, and integrity, of the contracting system has been subverted.  
 
JASOA is not registered on the CCR, nor is Mr. Law or Mr. Henry registered on the CCR.  They cannot competitively bid on the contracts you put out, they know that.  That said, any contractor who unwittingly steps into what they see as their domain they repeatedly boycott and thereby force the government to do a BPA with them for each sport.  This subverts both the integrity , and the free enterprise, of the contracting process.  And, this has been taking place for years.
 
My point is that we gave ample time with our request to be withdrawn from this contract for this to take place. 
 
Now, in light of the above facts, and in all fairness, I am requesting that 4 Peaks be released from this contract without any negative consequences and that a neutral termination, without cause, be found.  
  
Now, in closing, I hope this email does not come off as confrontational to you.  I am simply trying to lay out some of the facts that you may, or may not be, aware of; and then to appeal to your innate sense of fairness in any determination that you make.
 
If you have any questions, I would be glad to speak with you in person.  My cell number is:  217-552-6673.
 
Very Respectfully,   John Morton  "

KIS had delivered all product to the customer, and thereafter the customer declined the order and repurchased the product from a non-contract holder.    It is our contention that KIS should not be considered in default of this contract due to the delay in the receipt of the PO led to availability issues with key components of the order.  KIS is compelled to argue that after delivery of the product, the contract was cancelled.  KIS was left with a significant monetary loss trying to accommodate the customer and the contract, yet in spite of our best intentions and complete delivery of the product, the contract awarded  to a non-contract holder.  Please see the following timeline:

-	On 8/31/12 KIS quoted the product in question with a 4-6 week delivery window
-	On 10/9/2012 we received a PO (HHSN27600015) for this quote
o	This PO was received along with three additional NIH POs  signed off on between 8/30 and 9/12
-	When KIS received the order a portion of the product requested was on back order with manufacturer (Sony)
-	On 10/31/12 a partial order to shipped to the customer
o	At this time we requested from the distributor in writing a delivery time on the outstanding orders
o	It took the distributor until 11/7 to get us an answer of two more week until deliver.  We emailed this information to the customer
-	On 12/10/12  the balance of the order was delivered to the customer
-	On 12/20/12 the customer canceled the order   

KIS understands the provisions of the ECS III contract and the ability of the government to change its mind and has accepted the monetary loss that comes with this contract cancelation even after providing a best effort to deliver. In this regard, KIS contends that the government was arbitrary in cancelling this contract and creating the monetary loss to KIS."

AECI and its A&amp;E team were not able to find any similar towers in any branch of DOD to obtain any previous design information. AECI also asked for the criteria that the navy was using to reject the existing tower or the rejection of any proposed design solutions. Navy did supply any information or reference to the rejection criteria they were using. 
Additional designs supplied by AECI with Modeling without knowing what the Navy would accept 5-13-11, 7-21-11

On 20 April 2012, HCRN received the RTO for the Physical Therapist position to work at Malmstrom MT AFB. We transitioned the incumbent for an on time start.  In early May, our PT told us she was told by the Government that her position would not be funded in the upcoming fiscal year.  We contacted the gov. and we were told verbally that it was not clear if the position would be funded in the next fiscal year.  On 29 May 12 we received a resignation from our PT due to her concern for the stability of her position.  On 31 May 12 I was told again by the MTF that they were unsure if funding would be forthcoming. We offered a retention bonus and she declined. We began recruitment efforts on 5 June 12 as we were aware we would need as much lead time as possible to fill the PT vacancy.  There is a shortage of PTs - the transition from a Masters to a Doctorate Degree is deterring some people from entering the field.  Based on our knowledge of the market, we developed a multi-pronged approach.  Our recruitment efforts included the purchase of a membership on the APTA website giving us access to resumes; we placed ads on Monster.com, Indeed.com; we placed ads in local papers and surrounding towns; we contracted with 3 travel PT companies in an effort to expand our reach for candidates.  We also contacted several local PT centers in and around Great Falls, MT to try and fill the position on a job share basis.   We do not take our contractual obligations lightly and as evidenced by our efforts we have thoughtfully executed an aggressive recruitment strategy - money was not the issue - there were no candidates.  The brief length of the assignment coupled with the shortage of PTs and remote location were material factors contributing to our inability to fill. "

We have had numerous issues with the First Article being rejected on SPM4A6-11-M-HX22  due to the cord from Phoenix Rope and Cordage failing. After the last rejection, we ordered the cord from a different supplier and sent in a First Article to Natick on 1/31/13. We were confident that this would solve the issue and the F/A would be approved. When the F/A sample arrived at Natick, it was not checked and was returned on 03/18/13 due to ADEST not being authorized to reopen FAT. The only open item on the F/A rejection was the cord issue which we were very confident was corrected with the material from a different vendor. We did not understand why the resubmitted F/A was sent back without being checked thus not giving us the opportunity to correct the situation and receive F/A approval.  when our termination for default was received we then emailed courtney with an explination of the events that had happened prior to the cancellation of contract. we asked if there was anything that could be done by Courtney to reverse the cancellation and was told that at this time there was nothing more that could be done.

Contract Details: Mike Murphy of Noble signed a contract via email on January 30, 2013, to supply an Epson Projector and mount. Upon receipt of this award, Mr. Murphy contacted an established Noble vendor who provided a quote and stated that ¿The two items are on back order, and they will be shipping by 2/16.¿ 

On February 22, Mr. Murphy received an email Cure Notice from Contracting Specialist, Jayton Lee, noting Nobles inability to deliver the Epson Projector. Following up, Mr. Murphy discovered that Vendor would not, after all, be able fulfill the order. When he sought out a second supplier to procure the Epson Projector and mount, he was told that the part numbers quoted by the first vendor were incorrect. One item was an end-of-life item that was about to be discontinued and the other item quoted was a Latin America part number. After this clarification, Mr. Murphy determined he would not be able to supply the correct manufacturer part numbers on the original order. As a result of receiving incorrect information from a trusted vendor, Mr. Murphy was left with no further recourse but to take the default on the order. On February 27, Mr. Murphy informed William Ray, Contracting officer, of all the issues including his inability to purchase the correct item and respectfully requested a termination of the contract.

Lessons Learned and Corrective Actions: Following Nobles Quality Control Plan and Customer Satisfaction Policy, we performed a root cause analysis in response to this rare event with a trusted supplier. The Incident Management Team identified the potential for complacency when dealing with trusted suppliers.  Consequently, Noble implemented a procedure requiring the same follow-up and order verification process already in place with new suppliers be applied to all suppliers to mitigate a future occurrence.

Noble agreed to deliver 95 individual line items of varying quantities with completion scheduled for October 12, 2012. Noble had delivered items totaling $64,621.48 at time of termination when the contract was modified by TSgt Brittney Leyba and signed by Ryan Carr, Noble¿s VP of Sales, for the amount of the delivered items. Mr.Carr received the cause notice regarding this contract on January 4, 2013. Previous communication regarding the missing items had been sent to a Noble employee who was no longer with the company, which resulted in a delay in our response. While they did receive an automated response with an alternate contact, the customer opted to not send further communication. As soon as Mr. Carr was aware of the issue, he worked with TSgt Brittney Leyba to clarify which items had not been received and investigate the cause of the missing items. While working with TSgt Leyba, Mr. Carr did recover more than $4,000 of tools found in UPS¿s frustrated shipments center and expedited shipment to the ordering activity. Mr. Carr determined that items shipped to the customer in the initial shipment were lost in transit by UPS. He contacted UPS and was told they were unable to account for the lost shipment and would not provide any remuneration for the lost product. After an extensive inventory of the missing items, our customer determined that it would be too costly to reorder and reship the items lost by freight carrier. Throughout the investigation, Mr. Carr remained in communication with the Contract Officer (CO) and worked to offer a solution for Noble¿s partial default. The CO ultimately determined that a Termination for Cause was necessary to resource the missing items. Both parties agree the contract would be terminated because of delinquency in performance and delivery while the Government agreed Noble would be paid for the items accepted to that point."

The Incident Management Team identified and implemented two issues and their corrective actions: 
1.	Relying on the carrier to notify Noble of delivery resulted in the possibility that we might not be aware if an order was lost or misrouted. The Incident Management Team implemented an automated procedure for follow-up with parcel carriers to verify delivery. If an order is not received in our system within 4 hours of scheduled delivery, a message is sent to the Customer Service Representative to trigger a follow-up call to the carrier. 
2.	Miscommunication or missed messages can result from a single point of contact. As a corrective action, all order information is now automatically transmitted to the next person in authority when communication hasn¿t been returned within 24 hours.

Quantell was awarded the task order on 28 Sept 2012.  The TO required Quantell to provide 18 instructors in three phases.  5 instructors were required for Phase 1 on 28 Sept 2012.  Upon award, Quantell immediately began recruiting for Phase 1.  As part of its recruiting, Quantell forwarded, per the Navy request, resumes for Navy review/approval prior to in-processing.  That process delayed candidate start dates, causing several candidates to decline offers.  Moreover, after candidates were approved and ready for in-processing, Quantell forwarded information to the security POC to initiate the process.   However, the Navy waited until 15 Nov 2012 to tell Quantell that Navy security POC would not in-process the candidates. But for those delays, Quantell would have fully manned the TO by late October.  

                The Navy issued a Show Cause Notice on 30 Oct 2012. In response, Quantell gave the Navy information showing the Navy delayed in giving approvals for candidates and direction for in-processing. By 15 Nov 2012, the Navy agreed Quantell was not given sufficient time. However, the Navy gave Quantell just 14 days, until 29 Nov 2012, to provide 5 instructors. The Navy issued a termination notice on 24 Jan 2012. At that time, 3 of the 5 Phase 1 candidates had completed in-processing.  The Navy never addressed the delays caused by the Navy, failed to recognize a mistake in the evaluation of the Quantell proposal, and did not permit the use of experience to satisfy a requirement that certain candidates hold a masters degree in nursing.  Despite its refusal to accept the Quantell proposed candidates, we understand that subsequently the Navy waived the education requirement for the replacement contractor. Quantell has and is successfully performing over 100 task orders under the same contract for the Navy.  "

Ti disputes the findings in the COFD. Ti is filing suit in the Court of Federal Claims for wrongful termination and associated damages.

FAR 52.249-10(a), Default, permits USACE to T4D a Contractor¿s right to proceed, but not without limitations. USACE exceeded such limitations. Termination is not permitted if any delay arose from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of Ti. Ti experienced delays: due to acts of USACE in its sovereign and contractual capacity, acts of another Contractor in performing duties for USACE; due to subcontractors or suppliers that were unforeseeable and beyond the control and without Ti¿s or the subcontractors/suppliers fault or negligence; and due to weather. The FAR precludes termination for any one of these reasons.

USACE did not properly pay Ti. Reductions in percentages complete were arbitrary, unjustified, and made without any visit to the project site. ENG Form 93s are wrong. The contract file verifies these facts - making performance commercially impracticable.      

Allegedly deficiencies are unfounded. Ti performed all construction work per contract requirements. Independent consultants reviewed all work in place and found no deficient work. Ti never refused or failed to prosecute work. A review of the complete and official record makes that clear to any reader. Ti regularly and factually communicated with USACE about the project status and realities of construction in Afghanistan. While completion of the project was delayed,with proper review and credit for justified time extensions, Ti would have actually finished early.

Ti¿s bonding company,supported by Ti¿s project partner, presented USACE with two rational/ reasonable remedies to the concerns. USACE rejected both without logical explanation. Ti is confident the court system will vindicate Ti¿s position. Ti will willingly provide details to any reviewer in support of these sta"

Noble agreed to deliver 95 individual line items of varying quantities with completion scheduled for October 12, 2012. Noble had delivered items totaling $64,621.48 at time of termination when the contract was modified by TSgt Brittney Leyba and signed by Ryan Carr, Noble¿s VP of Sales, for the amount of the delivered items. Mr. Carr received the cause notice regarding this contract on January 4, 2013. Previous communication regarding the missing items had been sent to a Noble employee who was no longer with the company, which resulted in a delay in our response. While they did receive an automated response with an alternate contact, the customer opted to not send further communication. As soon as Mr. Carr was aware of the issue, he worked with TSgt Brittney Leyba to clarify which items had not been received and investigate the cause of the missing items. While working with TSgt Leyba, Mr. Carr did recover more than $4,000 of tools found in UPS¿s frustrated shipments center and expedited shipment to the ordering activity. Mr. Carr determined that items shipped to the customer in the initial shipment were lost in transit by UPS. He contacted UPS and was told they were unable to account for the lost shipment and would not provide any remuneration for the lost product. After an extensive inventory of the missing items, our customer determined that it would be too costly to reorder and reship the items lost by freight carrier. Throughout the investigation, Mr. Carr remained in communication with the Contracting Officer (CO)and worked to offer a solution for Noble¿s partial default. The CO ultimately determined that a Termination for Cause was necessary to resource the missing items. Both parties agree the contract would be terminated because of delinquency in performance and delivery while the Government agreed Noble would be paid for the items accepted to that point. "

The Incident Management Team identified and implemented two issues and their corrective actions: 1. Relying on the carrier to notify Noble of delivery resulted in the possibility that we might not be aware if an order was lost or misrouted. The Incident Management Team implemented an automated procedure for follow-up with parcel carriers to verify delivery. If an order is not received in our system within 4 hours of scheduled delivery, a message is sent to the Customer Service Representative to trigger a follow-up call to the carrier. 2. Miscommunication or missed messages can result from a single point of contact. As a corrective action, all order information is now automatically transmitted to the next person in authority when communication hasn¿t been returned within 24 hours. "

Noble agreed to deliver 95 individual line items of varying quantities with completion scheduled for October 12, 2012. Noble had delivered items totaling $64,621.48 at time of termination when the contract was modified by TSgt Brittney Leyba and signed by Ryan Carr, Noble¿s VP of Sales, for the amount of the delivered items. Mr. Carr received the cause notice regarding this contract on January 4, 2013. Previous communication regarding the missing items had been sent to a Noble employee who was no longer with the company, which resulted in a delay in our response. While they did receive an automated response with an alternate contact, the customer opted to not send further communication. As soon as Mr. Carr was aware of the issue, he worked with TSgt Brittney Leyba to clarify which items had not been received and investigate the cause of the missing items. While working with TSgt Leyba, Mr. Carr did recover more than $4,000 of tools found in UPS¿s frustrated shipments center and expedited shipment to the ordering activity. Mr. Carr determined that items shipped to the customer in the initial shipment were lost in transit by UPS. He contacted UPS and was told they were unable to account for the lost shipment and would not provide any remuneration for the lost product. After an extensive inventory of the missing items, our customer determined that it would be too costly to reorder and reship the items lost by freight carrier. Throughout the investigation, Mr. Carr remained in communication with the Contracting Officer (CO)and worked to offer a solution for Noble¿s partial default. The CO ultimately determined that a Termination for Cause was necessary to resource the missing items. Both parties agree the contract would be terminated because of delinquency in performance and delivery while the Government agreed Noble would be paid for the items accepted to that point.

The Incident Management Team identified and implemented two issues and their corrective actions: 1. Relying on the carrier to notify Noble of delivery resulted in the possibility that we might not be aware if an order was lost or misrouted. The Incident Management Team implemented an automated procedure for follow-up with parcel carriers to verify delivery. If an order is not received in our system within 4 hours of scheduled delivery, a message is sent to the Customer Service Representative to trigger a follow-up call to the carrier. 2. Miscommunication or missed messages can result from a single point of contact. As a corrective action, all order information is now automatically transmitted to the next person in authority when communication hasn¿t been returned within 24 hours. "

What the record does not show is why the itmes was not delivered on time. The government ordered two custom made projectors. The projectors were ordered the day after the contract was awarded. Verification was received from the supplieer that the projectors would be delivered on time but they were not. The supplier then said the compnay (Projection design) had been bought by Barco and was undergoing management changes but the projectors could be delivered and a date was again provided. Once again the delivery date was not met by the supplier however the government was advised the items were ready to be shipped. The government refused to accecpt the one week extension and canceled the contract. 

As a contractor this situation was beyond our control. As we explained to the government we could do nothing more than contact the suppliet wheich we did numerous tomes, with the government copied on the e-mail, and request the items be shipped. 

The government then awarded the contract to another compnay which contacted the same supplier (NOTE THERE WAS NO OTHER SOURCE AVAILABLE FOR THIS ITEM AND THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO ACCEPT A BRAND NAME OR EQUAL) WHO SHIPPED THE PROJECTORS THAT WERE NOW READY TO BE SHIPPED. 

The government did not look at the situation in a fair light and reacted as though ETS &amp; YCP LLC could and should have been able to force the manfacture to deliver faster, which was impossible. Also note the goverment was offered a discount andd a option for an alternative projector model which they refused. There was nothing more ETS &amp; YCP LLC could do in this situation."

Information To Be Withheld under Exemption 4 of FOIA

	Information regarding VPSI¿s privileged or confidential trade secrets and commercial or financial information should be withheld under Exemption 4 of FOIA. Exemption 4 protects the disclosure of privileged or confidential trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person.  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4); National Parks &amp; Conservation Ass¿n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  If the person or entity submitting the information was required to provide the government with the information in question, the information is confidential under Exemption 4 if it would (1) impair the government¿s ability obtain necessary information in the future, or (2) cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person who submitted the information.  Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm¿n, 975 F.2d 871, 880 (D.C. Cir. 1992); National Parks, 498 F.2d at 770.  If the information was provided on a voluntary basis, it is confidential under Exemption 4 if it is the kind that would customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.  Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 879.

	VPSI believes that the following information should be withheld from release under Exemption 4:

(1)	the listing of the number and percentage of VPSI shares owned by the estate of Vinh Vo (page 7 of the Agreement);

(2)	the amount paid by VPSI pursuant to the civil settlement agreement between VPSI and the United States (page 11 of the Agreement); and

(3)	the number of shares issued by VPSI, their par value and the number of shares owned by the estate of Vinh Vo (page 2 of the proxy agreement attached to the Agreement as Exhibit B).

The information regarding the number of shares issued by VPSI, the par value of the shares and the number of shares owned by Mr. Vo¿s estate is company proprietary information that is not publicly available.  A competitor of VPSI could use such information to engage in a valuation of the company, which could be used in a competitive procurement to develop pricing to underbid VPSI.  A competitor also could use a valuation of VPSI to adjust its overhead and general and administrative costs to develop a rate structure to compete against VPSI.  With respect to the settlement amount paid by VPSI under the Agreement, a competitor could use that information to understand VPSI¿s financial obligations and the impact those obligations would have on VPSI¿s ability to compete for and perform new work.  Courts have held that the release of such company financial information would cause competitive harm to the company.  See, e.g., National Parks &amp; Conservation Ass¿n v¿ Kleppe, 547 F.2d 673, 681 (D.C. Cir. 1976).

Assuming that VPSI provided such information voluntarily, such information is that kind that VPSI customarily would not release outside of the company.  VPSI is a privately held company, and as such would not make information such as share numbers, ownership or par value available to the public.  Courts have held that such information not customarily released would be exempt from release under FOIA.  Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 879.  Accordingly, the information in the Agreement regarding VPSI¿s stock issuance and ownership and the amount of its settlement with the government should be withheld from release under Exemption 4 of FOIA."

Information To Be Withheld under Exemption 6 of FOIA

	Personal information regarding VPSI¿s former owner, current majority owner and proxy holder is exempt from release under Exemption 6 of FOIA.  Exemption 6 of FOIA protects information about individuals in ¿personnel and medical and similar files¿ from disclosure where the disclosure of such information ¿would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.¿  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6).  The United States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. Washington Post Co., 456 U.S. 595 (1982), held that Congress intended for the term ¿similar files¿ to be interpreted broadly, and that all information that ¿applies to a particular individual¿ meets the threshold requirement for Exemption 6 protection.  Id. at 602; see also Forest Serv. Employees for Envtl. Ethics v. United States Forest Serv., 524 F.3d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 2008) (stating that the threshold test of Exemption 6 is satisfied when government records contain information applying to particular individuals).  Courts have applied this exemption to personal information such as names and home addresses.  See Associated Press v. Department of Justice, 549 F.3d 62, 65 (2d Cir. 2008) (¿Personal information, including a citizen¿s name, address, and criminal history, has been found to implicate a privacy interest cognizable under the FOIA exemptions.¿); Yelder v. Department of Defense, 577 F. Supp. 2d 342, 346 (D.D.C. 2008 (noting that information such as names, addresses and other personally identifying information creates a palpable threat to privacy)."

As fully discussed below, the government has posted an administrative agreement (¿the Agreement¿) on FAPIIS which was entered into by VPSI and the Department of the Navy (¿Navy¿) and which contains information that would be exempt from release to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (¿FOIA¿), 5 U.S.C. § 552.  For the reasons set forth below, VPSI would request that the designated information be withheld from release pursuant to the applicable FOIA exemptions and the requirements of FAR § 52.209-9.  This request is timely filed within seven (7) days of the posting of the Agreement on FAPIIS, which occurred on January 13, 2014.

I.	INFORMATION TO BE WITHHELD FROM RELEASE UNDER FOIA

	The Navy and VPSI entered into the Agreement on August 5, 2013.  The Agreement outlines the steps to be taken by VPSI to implement its contractor responsibility program.  Included in the Agreement are two categories of information that are exempt from release under FOIA and should be redacted in the Agreement:  (1) privileged or confidential trade secrets and commercial or financial information exempt under Exemption 4 of FOIA; and (2) information about individuals exempt under Exemption 6 of FOIA.  The bases to withhold this information under both categories of FOIA exemptions is discussed below."

Because VPSI is a privately held company and the names of its officers and other agents are not publicly available, Mr. Hekman, Ms. Trinh and Mr. Vo have a privacy interest in protecting their name in their capacity as current / former officer and agent of VPSI as well as the address of their private residence.  See Associated Press, 549 F.2d at 65.  Similarly, the address of the location at which the search warrant was executed is Mr. Vo¿s former residence.  Id.

Cir. 2009) (¿We have . . . recognized substantial privacy interests in business-related financial information for individually owned or closely held businesses.¿).  The proxy agreement appended to the Agreement would constitute a ¿business record¿ of VPSI, and its release would violate the privacy interests of Mr. Hekman, Ms. Trinh and Mr. Vo with respect to their current / former roles in the company.  Accordingly, the information in the Agreement regarding the names and addresses of VPSI¿s proxy holder and majority stockholder and Mr. Vo¿s name and the location at which the search warrant was executed are exempt from release under Exemption 6 of FOIA."

The contract called for the delivery of three different items.

A dispute arose between the Government and BTOS concerning the obligations of the Government to provide documents critical to the delivery of the three end items. As a result the contract was terminated for default in October 2010.

BTOS appealed the termination for default to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA).

The ASBCA reversed the termination for default and converted it to a termination for convenience for one of the three deliverables and upheld the termination for default with respect to two of the three deliverables.

BTOS has filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the opinion with respect to the termination for default portions and is optimistic about its prospects to convert these two remaining portions of the termination for default into a termination for convenience. A decision is pending.

As recognized in paragraph 1 of the Administrative Agreement, the sole purpose of this Agreement is to evidence that Contractor is presently responsible to conduct business with the United States Government. The Department of the Navy Suspension and Debarment Official determined that Sabtech has put into place corrective actions and prospective compliance with the obligations of the Administrative Agreement that provides adequate assurances that Sabtech future dealings with the US Government will be conducted with the highest level of honesty and integrity required of a responsible government contractor.

Sabtech was suspended because of the misconduct of the former owner of the company who is alleged to had made false statements to his government customer several years ago as it related to his relationship with a third party contractor. There were never concerns relative to Sabtech, products, services, or performance on government contracts. Since those events, Sabtech has been purchased by the Sabtech CEO, Michael Carter, and is now under his leadership. The former owners misconduct was not disclosed to Mr. Carter until after the suspension was issued. Mr. Carter has recruited and retained an ethical leadership team to support the growth of the company, including an experienced CFO and a Ethics and Compliance Officer. Sabtech also has an independent Board of Directors comprised of highly experienced Military and Defense executives. Sabtech continues to enhance a Ethics and Compliance program and is firmly committed to adhering to company core values and serving government and civilian customers"

This record must not be considered by any Agency and any Agency must contact us for formal rebuttal in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(ii) and FAR 15.306(b)(1)(i).

This termination was unquestionable ""wrongful"" and is currently under dispute in the US Court of Federal Claims No. 11-705 C (Judge Lettow). The FEMA Contracting Officer never responded to any contractor communications regarding this matter. FEMA solicited critical data that was absolutely false and known by FEMA to be false. The Contracting Officer subsequently created a fraudulent performance term (delivery date) that is nowhere in this service contract to use as a fictitious reason to create a ""post"" performance default condition. Meanwhile the same Contracting Officer award (again) to their intendant favorite and known fraudulent SDVOSB and ineligible company as determined under an SBA Protest determination.  FEMA ignored the SBA ruling and continued with award to the ineligible company. This award (October 4, 2010) occurred weeks prior to this wrongful termination and prior to even a Show Cause notice. This termination was recently posted in FAPIIS only because of our known intent to proposal on the exact kind of work in the near future. This is a clear attempt by FEMA to falsely remove us from competition against their favorite and fraudulent contractor. Please contact me (Christopher Kaes Pres-CEO 800-252-5237) directly for copies of all pertinent documentation that clearly proves this is more than just a wrongful termination."

Upon receiving acknowledgment to our purchase order on 10/29/13 from subcontractor MMB confirming parts are in new and unused serviceable condition we signed the Bilateral agreement and forwarded it to the buyer. We received the official copy of the award on 10/31/13. When parts were received in our warehouse they failed inspection due to corrosion that was spotted on them that was not seen in the initial inspection. Parts from MMB were rejected by Aviarms QC.  Aviarms tried to locate replacement material so that we could meet our contractual obligation.  Aviarms attempted to search for same parts but since parts are previously owned government surplus, there was no inventory to be found to replace the rejected parts. When we exhausted every possible avenue of supply, we had no choice but to request a modification to cancel the contract."

Regardless of these findings it is important to recognize that Action Target  is the industry leading provider of range systems throughout the world; and strives to provide the necessary products to equip and prepare our military, law enforcement and commercial clients.  Unfortunately a decision was made over 3 years ago to divert from our core business to invest in the development of the ATS program.  We have analyzed our shortcomings and have implemented the necessary corrective actions regarding the government findings. 
In response to the programs failure significant changes where made to internal processes, employees and executive staff at Action Target.  Today, the business is thriving and has refocused on its core as well as invested in a new management team to continue driving profitable and sustainable growth for its shareholders.
We sincerely regret that Action Target could not meet the expectations of the ATS program yet are hopeful that with the right staff, R&amp;D and schedule may have the opportunity to revisit the program in the future."
